| Dec 2  |    class     |                                                                                                                                                                            We went down a few different ways to compress code but didn't flesh out/weren't satisfied with any one. We considered compressing each letter into a 6 or 8-bit code or compressing each word (by organizing words into map). |
| Dec 2  | 8:15-8:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                     I was talking with my brother and think a bit about what we did in class. I didn't exactly come up with a better solution, but decided I didn't love the idea of mapping words to keys. There just aren't enough repeated words to make it worth it. |
| Dec 4  | 12:40-1:45pm | I was trying to think about a way where we can utilize both repeated words and repeated letter combinations (ing, ed, pre, post, etc). If you use a hash table to store every combination it would get too big. I also don't know how to do this without looping through the data two times. I considered putting found works into a trie, but I'm not sure how you would re-access them quickly then... |
| Dec 6  |   10-10:30   |                                                                                                                                                      I still like the idea of storing more words: maybe storing all of the letter sequences greater than three within the first 100 words. That could balance the size of what you're storing while still getting most of the common words and suffixes. |
| Dec 8  |    4:15-5    |                                                                                                                                                                                         I started writing out compress using the class slides. I had some trouble getting the TST class imported and working. I also couldn't figure out where things where printing to: I don't see it in the terminal. |

I left a bunch of small comments with questions I have -- most to do with how best to check if i'm going out of bounds. |

I changed compress to read in the first 256 characters instead of 125 as I was earlier. I also started on expand: thinking about everything backwards is a lot slower/ |
