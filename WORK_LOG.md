| Dec 2 |    class     |                                                                                                                                                                            We went down a few different ways to compress code but didn't flesh out/weren't satisfied with any one. We considered compressing each letter into a 6 or 8-bit code or compressing each word (by organizing words into map). |
| Dec 2 | 8:15-8:45pm  |                                                                                                                                                     I was talking with my brother and think a bit about what we did in class. I didn't exactly come up with a better solution, but decided I didn't love the idea of mapping words to keys. There just aren't enough repeated words to make it worth it. |
| Dec 4 | 12:40-1:45pm | I was trying to think about a way where we can utilize both repeated words and repeated letter combinations (ing, ed, pre, post, etc). If you use a hash table to store every combination it would get too big. I also don't know how to do this without looping through the data two times. I considered putting found works into a trie, but I'm not sure how you would re-access them quickly then... |
